Kickoff Sprint 1

Theme: Foundation Sprint

Goal: By the end of this sprint, you should be able to open Kinora in a browser (or on your phone), create an account, create a family, and create your first event.

Sprint 1 Deliverables
1. Technology Decision (60–90 minutes)

This is the only major planning item left before we write code.

We'll decide:

Frontend
Backend
Database
Authentication
Hosting
Deployment
Repository structure
Development workflow

This isn't just picking popular tools. We'll choose based on:

Fast development
Mobile-first experience
Low cost
Easy deployment
Scalability
Your willingness to learn

By the end of the meeting, there should be no technology uncertainty left.
